## Overview

This project involves the modeling and simulation of thermal behavior in an accumulator (battery pack) using MATLAB Simulink. The study focuses on how heat is generated within battery cells during charging and discharging cycles and how it is transferred across the accumulator structure. A cooling loop system is then integrated into the model to manage the temperature rise, ensuring safe and efficient operation.

## Key Features

- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation with Storybook to showcase components, usage patterns, and best practices, ensuring the design system is easy to adopt by other teams.

## Technologies Used

- **Matlab**: For run the simulation test.


## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge was balancing the need for flexibility with the desire to maintain design consistency. The solution involved creating well-defined design tokens and establishing clear guidelines for when and how components could be customized. Additionally, setting up effective collaboration workflows between designers and developers using Figma and Git was a learning experience that greatly improved the process.

## Outcome

The design system is now actively used across multiple projects, leading to faster development cycles, fewer design inconsistencies, and improved collaboration between design and development teams. It has become a foundation for scaling our products efficiently while ensuring a cohesive user experience.
