## Overview

Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. However, battery cells generate heat during charging/discharging due to internal resistance and electrochemical reactions. Excessive temperature rise can degrade battery performance, shorten lifespan, and increase the risk of thermal runaway.

To manage heat, battery thermal management systems (BTMS) are implemented. This project develops a MATLAB/Simulink model to analyze:
- Heat generation in the battery pack.
- Heat transfer within cells and modules.
- Convective cooling using a liquid cooling loop.


## Objectives

- Model heat generation of a Li-ion battery pack.
- Implement thermal transfer (conduction & convection) equations.
- Design a liquid cooling loop with coolant flow.
- Simulate system performance under different discharge rates (C-rates).
- Evaluate effectiveness of the cooling system.



## MATLAB/Simulink Model Design Components

- **Battery Pack Subsystem**: Equivalent circuit model, heat generation block.
- **Thermal Subsystem**: Heat transfer equations, RC thermal model.
- **Cooling Loop Subsystem**: Pump, coolant thermal dynamics, heat exchanger.
- **Control System**: Feedback control for coolant flow.


## Simulink Implementation

- Simscape Electrical for electrical model.
- Simscape Thermal for heat transfer.
- Simscape Fluids for coolant loop modeling.
- Coupling: Electrical → Heat → Thermal → Cooling loop.

## Results & Discussion

- Temperature rise curves show uncontrolled heating can exceed 60°C at high C-rate.
- Cooling loop maintains temperature within 25–40°C safe range.**
- Adaptive control improves cooling efficiency and reduces energy consumption of pump.
- Heat distribution across modules shows reduced thermal gradients.

## Conclusion

This MATLAB/Simulink project demonstrates a practical model for battery thermal management.
- Heat generation is strongly dependent on current and resistance.
- Cooling loop with liquid convection effectively regulates temperature.
- Simulink allows integration of electrical, thermal, and fluid domains.
