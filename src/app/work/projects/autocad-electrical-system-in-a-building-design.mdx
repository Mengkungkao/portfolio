## Overview

In this project, I will describe about a conceptual design of a three-phase low-voltage electrical routing system for reliable power supply to medical equipment.

## Key Features

- **Three-phase low-voltage supply system**
- **Integration of safety and protection devices**
- **Efficient routing to minimize power losses**
- **Compliance with electrical safety standards for medical facilities**

## Electrical Components

- **Exhaust fan**
- **Booster fan**
- **Dehumidifier**
- **Variable Speed Drive (VSD)**
- **Control panel**
- **Protection devices (MCB, RCCB, Relays)**

## Single Line Diagram

A single-line diagram (SLD) is developed to illustrate the power flow from the main supply through protective devices and distribution panels to end equipment. This diagram provides a clear overview of system connections and ensures ease of maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing a system that balances load demands and safety compliance.
Addressing redundancy requirements for critical medical operations.
Learning to optimize the use of VSDs for energy efficiency.
Applying theoretical knowledge to practical system layout and component selection.

## Outcome

The project resulted in a well-structured electrical routing concept capable of delivering stable and reliable power to medical equipment. The design ensures safety, operational efficiency, and adaptability for future expansion.
