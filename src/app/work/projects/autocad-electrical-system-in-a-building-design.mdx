## 1. Introduction  
This project presents a **conceptual design** of a **three-phase low-voltage electrical routing system** to provide a **reliable power supply** to critical medical equipment.  

The design emphasizes:  
- **Safety:** Use of protection devices (MCB, RCCB, relays, fuses).  
- **Efficiency:** Optimized routing to reduce power losses.  
- **Redundancy:** Ensures uninterrupted operation of sensitive devices.  
- **Compliance:** Meets electrical safety standards for medical facilities.

## 2. Key Features  
- Three-phase low-voltage supply system.  
- Integration of safety and protection devices.  
- Efficient routing with reduced I²R losses.  
- Compliance with **IEC 60364** and **AS/NZS 3000 (Wiring Rules)**.  
- Provision for future expansion and redundancy.

## 4. Single Line Diagram 

A single-line diagram (SLD) is a simplified graphical representation of an electrical system, showing the connections and relationships between components. Symbols represent equipment such as transformers, circuit breakers, and fuses, while lines represent energized or unenergized conductors.

## 5. Cable Sizing & Voltage Drop

### 5.1 Cable Sizing  
- Based on **IEC 60287** (current capacity) and **voltage drop** calculations.  
- Factors considered: load current, length of run, ambient temperature, grouping.  

### 5.2 Voltage Drop
- Based on **IEC 60287 Voltage drop** is limit by 5%.
**Formula for voltage drop of phase to phase/phase to neutral:**  
```math
Delta_V_{drop} = 2 × Ib × (Rcosφ + Xsinφ) × L
```

**Formula for voltage drop of balanced 3-phase:**  
```math
Delta_V_{drop} = sqrt(3) × Ib × (Rcosφ + Xsinφ) × L
```

## 7. Normal Operation Modes for Exhaust & Booster Fan

### 7.1. Manual Mode

- Selector switch must be set to **Manual**.
- Operator can **Start/Stop** the fan via push buttons located on the **cover panel**.

### 7.2. Automatic Mode

- Selector switch must be set to **Auto**.
- Exhaust Air Fan will automatically run when it receives a **dry contact signal** from the **room thermostat**.
- Speed control is based on the 0–10V feedback from the pressure transmitter.
