## Overview

A design portfolio website serves as a digital showcase of projects, skills, and professional achievements. Hosting an open-source portfolio on GitHub with modern frameworks ensures easy collaboration, continuous updates, and deployment.

This project leverages Next.js for front-end development, Vercel for hosting and CI/CD, and the Once.UI Teams template for a clean, customizable UI framework.

## Objectives  
- Build a responsive and modern portfolio website.  
- Integrate an **open-source workflow** using GitHub repositories.  
- Deploy automatically with **Vercel’s GitHub integration**.  
- Use **Once.UI Teams template** for a professional, pre-styled layout.  
- Provide easy customization for designers, engineers, and developers.
